"Returning humanity to healthcare by solving the Small Practice Squeeze"

### The Problem
Independent clinics trapped between rising administrative costs and physician burnout

### The Solution
Agentic AI that handles logistics so doctors can focus on patients, not paperwork

### The 3 Pillars

1. **Clinical-First AI**
   - We don't replace doctors—we protect their time
   - AI handles logistics, physicians handle medicine

2. **Closed-Loop Care**
   - No patient falls through the cracks
   - Track every handoff, confirm every appointment

3. **RADICAL Transparency**
   - Ethics-led AI that is HIPAA-native
   - Explainable decisions, protected data, auditable algorithms

### The 2026 Edge

- **Role-Based Triage**: AI routes patients based on clinical need, insurance, and availability
- **Smart Logistics**: Traffic-aware appointment reminders with real-time leave times
- **Predictive Capacity Planning**: AI forecasts no-shows and optimizes schedules

## Brand Voice

### Tone
- Grounded but visionary
- Empathetic (acknowledges provider exhaustion)
- Clinical efficiency language (not Silicon Valley buzzwords)

### Key Phrases
- "Small Practice Squeeze"
- "Returning humanity to healthcare"
- "Reclaim your 9:00 PM"
- "Protect their time"
- "No patient falls through the cracks"

## Visual Identity
